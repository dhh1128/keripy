        An Edge Section is itself an Edge-group and MAY nest further Edge-groups, so

        flat edge. Every Edge found, at any depth, evaluates to a member verdict;

        section's own reduction is the value returned. Nothing is disposed of here --

        The walk is pre-order, so a group is yielded before its children and every
